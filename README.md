# Project City 13

## Configuration
The gamemode will load configurations from data/c13/config.json. It will be generated upon first time loading.

## Roles
When players spawn in, they get to select their initial jobs/roles specified in the config.json. 
It will give them the basic loadout and then only the administrator can change the player's job and/or permissions
later on in the game. 

## Rules
Server rules I guess..

## Credits
