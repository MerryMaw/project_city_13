# Project City 13

## Configuration
The gamemode will load configurations from data/c13/config.json. It will be generated upon first time loading.

The gamemode works stand alone and does not require any special maps or addons to function. It can be configured through config files entirely or generated map config files ingame on a map (or multiple maps) of your choosing.

It uses SQLite as database, not that there is much to store, as the gamemode is round based. You can configure the SQLite configurations from the config.json file.

## Roles
When players spawn in, they get to select their initial jobs/roles specified in the config.json. 
It will give them the basic loadout and then only the administrator can change the player's job and/or permissions
later on in the game. 

## Rules
Server rules I guess..
